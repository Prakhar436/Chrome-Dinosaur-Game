# Chrome Dinosaur Game Remastered

This project is a remastered version of the classic Chrome Dinosaur Game, built entirely from scratch using JavaScript. The codebase is organized into a highly modular architecture, with each component—such as the player character, hurdles, background, and sound—encapsulated within its own module. This clean separation of concerns makes the game easy to maintain, extend, and debug.

Leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, the project efficiently manages multiple dino characters and stages logic, allowing each element to operate independently while seamlessly integrating into the overall game framework. Additionally, an event-driven architecture ensures loose coupling among modules, enabling dynamic communication and enhancing flexibility, scalability, and upgradability.
