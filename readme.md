# Chrome Dinosaur Game Remastered

This project is a remastered version of the classic Chrome Dinosaur Game, built from scratch with JavsScript. The codebase features a highly modular structure, with each component—such as the player character, obstacles, background, and sound—encapsulated in its own JavaScript module. This design ensures clean separation of concerns, making the game easy to maintain, extend, and debug.
